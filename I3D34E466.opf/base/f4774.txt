The Licchavi Vimalakīrti created ninety million lion-thrones exactly like those already there,and the bodhisattvas were s
eated.Then, the incarnation-bodhisattva gave the vessel full of food to Vimalakīrti,and the fragrance of that food perme
ated the entire great city of Vaiśālīand its sweet perfume spread throughout one hundred universes.Within the city of Va
iśālī, the brahmans, householders, and even the Licchavi chieftain Candracchattra, having noticed this fragrance, were a
mazed and filled with wonder.They were so cleansed in body and mind that they came at once to the house of Vimalakīrti, 
along with all eighty-four thousand of the Licchavis.Seeing there the bodhisattvas seated on the high, wide, and beautif
ul lion-thrones, they were filled with admiration and great joy. They all bowed down to those great disciples and bodhis
attvas and then sat down to one side.And the gods of the earth, the gods of the desire-world, and the gods of the materi
al world, attracted by the perfume, also came to the house of Vimalakīrti.
