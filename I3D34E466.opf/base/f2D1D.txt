The bodhisattva Pratyakṣadarśana declared,"’Destructible’ and ’indestructible’ are dualistic.What is destroyed is ultimat
ely destroyed.What is ultimately destroyed does not become destroyed;hence, it is called ’indestructible.’What is indest
ructible is instantaneous,and what is instantaneous is indestructible.The experience of such is called ’the entrance int
o the principle of nonduality.’"
