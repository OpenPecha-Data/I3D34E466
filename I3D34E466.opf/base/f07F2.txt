The bodhisattva Śāntendriya declared,"It is dualistic to say ’Buddha,’ ’Dharma,’ and ’Sangha.’The Dharma is itself the na
ture of the Buddha, the Sangha is itself the nature of the Dharma,and all of them are uncompounded.The uncompounded is i
nfinite space,and the processes of all things are equivalent to infinite space.Adjustment to this is the entrance into n
onduality."
