Reverend Mahamaud galyayana, how could there be a teaching in regard to such a Dharma?Reverend Mahamaud galyayana, even t
he expression to teach the Dharma is presumptuousand those who listen to it listen to presumption.Reverend Maudgalyāyana
, where there are no presumptuous words, there is no teacher of the Dharma, no one to listen, and no one to understand.I
t is as if an illusory person were to teach the Dharma to illusory people.
