At that, the incarnated bodhisattva said, "Very good!" to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti and obeyed his instructions.In sight o
f all the bodhisattvas, he turned his face upward and was gone, and they saw him no more.

When he reached the universe Sarvagandhasugandhā,he bowed down at the feet of the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa and said,"Lord, 
the bodhisattva Vimalakīrti, bowing down at the feet of the Lord, greets the Lord, saying:’Do you have little trouble, l
ittle discomfort, and little unrest? Are you strong, well, without complaint, and living in touch with the supreme happi
ness?’

He then requests, having bowed down one hundred thousand times at the feet of the Lord:’May the Lord be gracious and give
to me the remains of his meal in order to accomplish the buddha-work in the universe called Sahā.Then, those living bei
ngs who aspire to inferior ways may gain the intelligence to aspire to the great Dharma of the Buddha,and the name of th
e Buddha will be celebrated far and wide.’"
