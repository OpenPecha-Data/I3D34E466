Then the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the patriarch Mahākāśyapa,"Reverend Mahākāśyapa, the Māras who play the devil in th
e innumerable universes of the ten directionsare all bodhisattvas dwelling in the inconceivable liberation, who are play
ing the devil in order to develop living beings through their skill in liberative technique.Reverend Mahākāśyapa, all th
e miserable beggars who come to the bodhisattvas of the innumerable universes of the ten directions to ask for a hand, a
foot,an ear, a nose, some blood, muscles, bones, marrow, an eye, a torso, a head, a limb,a member, a throne, a kingdom,
a country, a wife, a son, a daughter, a slave, a slave-girl, a horse, an elephant, a chariot, a cart,gold, silver, jewe
ls, pearls, conches, crystal, coral, beryl, treasures,food, drink, elixirs, and clothes -these demanding beggars are usu
ally bodhisattvas living in the inconceivable liberation who, through their skill in liberative technique, wish to test 
and thus demonstrate the firmness of the high resolve of the bodhisattvas.Why?Reverend Mahākāśyapa, the bodhisattvas dem
onstrate that firmness by means of terrible austerities.Ordinary persons have no power to be thus demanding of bodhisatt
vas, unless they are granted the opportunity. They are not capable of killing and depriving in that manner without being
freely given the chance."Reverend Mahākāśyapa, just as a glowworm cannot eclipse the light of the sun,so reverend Mahāk
āśyapa, it is not possible without special allowance that an ordinary person can thus attack and deprive a bodhisattva.

Reverend Mahākāśyapa, just as a donkey could not muster an attack on a wild elephant,even so, reverend Mahākāśyapa, one w
ho is not himself a bodhisattva cannot harass another bodhisattva,and only a bodhisattva can tolerate the harassment of 
another bodhisattva.Reverend Mahākāśyapa, such is the introduction to the power of the knowledge of liberative technique
of the bodhisattvas who live in the inconceivable liberation."
