Vimalakīrti: Mañjuśrī, with what in mind do you say so?

Mañjuśrī: Noble sir, one who stays in the fixed determination of the vision of the uncreated is not capable of conceiving
the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment.However, one who lives among created things, in the mines of passions, w
ithout seeing any truth,is indeed capable of conceiving the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment.Noble sir, flower
s like the blue lotus, the red lotus, the white lotus, the water lily, and the moon lily do not grow on the dry ground i
n the wilderness,but do grow in the swamps and mud banks.Just so, the Buddha-qualities do not grow in living beings cert
ainly destined for the uncreatedbut do grow in those living beings who are like swamps and mud banks of passions.Likewis
e, as seeds do not grow in the skybut do grow in the earth,so the Buddha-qualities do not grow in those determined for t
he absolute(but do grow in those who conceive the spirit of enlightenment), after having produced a Sumeru-like mountain
of egoistic views.but do grow in those who conceive the spirit of enlightenment, (after having produced a Sumeru-like m
ountain of egoistic views. )Noble sir, through these considerations one can understand that all passions constitute the 
family of the Tathāgatas.For example, noble sir, without going out into the great ocean, it is impossible to find precio
us, priceless pearls.Likewise, without going into the ocean of passions, it is impossible to obtain the mind of omniscie
nce.
