"’Noble son, when bodhisattvas are thus endowed with the transcendences,the roots of virtue, the ability to develop livin
g beings,and the incorporation of the holy Dharma,whether they lift up their feet or put them down,they all come from th
e seat of enlightenment. They come from the qualities of the Buddha, and stand on the qualities of the Buddha.’
