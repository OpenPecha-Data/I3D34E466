The bodhisattvas exclaimed,"How great must that bodhisattva be himself if his magical incarnation is thus endowed with su
pernatural power, strength, and fearlessness!"

The Tathāgata said,"The greatness of that bodhisattva is such that he sends magical incarnations to all the buddha-fields
of the ten directions,and all these incarnations accomplish the buddha-work for all the living beings in all those budd
ha-fields."
