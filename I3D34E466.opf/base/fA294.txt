Then the Buddha said to the venerable Ānanda,"Receive then, Ānanda, this expression of the teaching of the Dharma. Rememb
er it, and teach it widely and correctly to others!"

Ānanda replied, "I have memorized, Lord, this expression of the teaching of the Dharma.But what is the name of this teach
ing,and how should I remember it?"

The Buddha said,"Ānanda, this exposition of the Dharma is called ’The Teaching of Vimalakīrti,’ or ’The Reconciliation of
Dichotomies,’ or even ’Section of the Inconceivable Liberation.’Remember it thus!"

Thus spoke the Buddha. And the Licchavi Vimalakīrti, the crown prince Mañjuśrī, the venerable Ānanda, the bodhisattvas, t
he great disciples, the entire multitude, and the whole universe with its gods, men, asuras and gandharvas, rejoiced exc
eedingly. All heartily praised these declarations by the Lord.
