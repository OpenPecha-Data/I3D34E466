Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the crown prince, Mañjuśrī,"Mañjuśrī, you have already been in innumerable hundred
s of thousands of buddha-fields throughout the universes of the ten directions.In which buddha-field did you see the bes
t lion-thrones with the finest qualities?"Mañjuśrī replied,"Noble sir, if one crosses the buddha-fields to the east, whi
ch are more numerous than all the grains of sand of thirty-two Ganges rivers, one will discover a universe called Merudh
vaja.There dwells a Tathāgata called Merupradīparāja.His body measures eighty-four hundred thousand leagues in height,an
d the height of his throne is sixty-eight hundred thousand leagues.The bodhisattvas there are forty-two hundred thousand
leagues talland their own thrones are thirty-four hundred thousand leagues high.Noble sir, the finest and most superb t
hrones exist in that universe Merudhvaja, which is the buddha-field of the Tathāgata Merupradīparāja."
