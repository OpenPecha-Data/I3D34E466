Then, the goddess said to the venerable Śāriputra,"Reverend Śāriputra, why do you shake these flowers?"Śāriputra replied,
"Goddess, these flowers are not proper for religious personsand so we are trying to shake them off."The goddess said, "
Do not say that, reverend Śāriputra.Why?These flowers are proper indeed!Why?Such flowers have neither constructual thoug
ht nor discrimination.But the elder Śāriputra has both constructual thought and discrimination."Reverend Śāriputra, impr
opriety for one who has renounced the world for the discipline of the rightly taught Dharma consists of constructual tho
ught and discrimination,yet the elders are full of such thoughts.One who is without such thoughts is always proper."Reve
rend Śāriputra, see how these flowers do not stick to the bodies of these great spiritual heroes, the bodhisattvas! This
is because they have eliminated constructual thoughts and discriminations. "For example, evil spirits have power over f
earful men but cannot disturb the fearless.Likewise, those intimidated by fear of the world are in the power of forms, s
ounds, smells, tastes, and textures,which do not disturb those who are free from fear of the passions inherent in the co
nstructive world.Thus, these flowers stick to the bodies of those who have not eliminated their instincts for the passio
nsand do not stick to the bodies of those who have eliminated their instincts.Therefore, the flowers do not stick to the
bodies of these bodhisattvas, who have abandoned all instincts."
