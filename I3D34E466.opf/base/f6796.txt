He wore the white clothes of the layman, yet lived impeccably like a religious devotee.He lived at home, but remained alo
of from the realm of desire, the realm of pure matter, and the immaterial realm.He had a son, a wife, and female attenda
nts, yet always maintained continence.He appeared to be surrounded by servants, yet lived in solitude.He appeared to be 
adorned with ornaments, yet always was endowed with the auspicious signs and marks.He seemed to eat and drink, yet alway
s took nourishment from the taste of meditation.He made his appearance at the fields of sports and in the casinos, but h
is aim was always to mature those people who were attached to games and gambling.He visited the fashionable heterodox te
achers, yet always kept unswerving loyalty to the Buddha.He understood the mundane and transcendental sciences and esote
ric practices, yet always took pleasure in the delights of the Dharma.He mixed in all crowds, yet was respected as forem
ost of all.
