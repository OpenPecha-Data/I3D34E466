Reverend Mahākāśyapa, to avoid the houses of the wealthy, and to favor the houses of the poor - this is partiality in ben
evolence.Reverend Mahākāśyapa, you should dwell on the fact of the equality of things, and you should seek alms with con
sideration for all living beings at all times.You should beg your food in awareness of the ultimate non-existence of foo
d.You should seek alms for the sake of eliminating the materialism of others.When you enter a town, you should keep in m
ind its actual voidnessyet you should proceed through it in order to develop men and women.You should enter homes as if 
entering the family of the Buddha.
