Reverend Śāriputra, this is not the way to absorb yourself in contemplation.You should absorb yourself in contemplation s
o that neither body nor mind appear anywhere in the triple world.You should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a w
ay that you can manifest all ordinary behavior without forsaking cessation.You should absorb yourself in contemplation i
n such a way that you can manifest the nature of an ordinary person without abandoning your cultivated spiritual nature.
You should absorb yourself in contemplation so that the mind neither settles within nor moves without toward external fo
rms.You should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment are manifest w
ithout deviation toward any convictions.You should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you are released 
in liberation without abandoning the passions that are the province of the world.Reverend Śāriputra, those who absorb th
emselves in contemplation in such a way are declared by the Lord to be truly absorbed in contemplation.
