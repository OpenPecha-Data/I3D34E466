Nevertheless, reverend Śāriputra, just as one cannot smell the castor plant in a magnolia wood, but only the magnolia flo
wers,so, reverend Śāriputra, living in this house, which is redolent with the perfume of the virtues of the Buddha-quali
ties, one does not smell the perfume of the disciples and the solitary sages.Reverend Śāriputra, the Sakras, the Brahmās
, the Lokapālas, the devas, nagas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas who live in this househe
ar the Dharma from the mouth of this holy man and, enticed by the perfume of the virtues of the Buddha-qualities, procee
d to conceive the spirit of enlightenment.Reverend Śāriputra, I have been in this house for twelve years, and I have hea
rd no discourses concerning the disciples and solitary sages but have heard only those concerning the great love, the gr
eat compassion, and the inconceivable qualities of the Buddha.
