It is the seat of all living beings, because all living beings are without intrinsic identity.It is the seat of all thing
s, because it is perfectly enlightened with regard to voidness."’It is the seat of the conquest of all devils, because i
t never flinches.It is the seat of the triple world, because it is free of involvement.It is the seat of the heroism tha
t sounds the lion’s roar, because it is free of fear and trembling.It is the seat of the strengths, the fearlessnesses, 
and all the special qualities of the Buddha, because it is irreproachable in all respects.It is the seat of the three kn
owledges, because in it no passions remain.It is the seat of instantaneous, total understanding of all things, because i
t realizes fully the gnosis of omniscience.
