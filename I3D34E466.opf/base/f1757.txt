Furthermore, reverend Ä€nanda, if monks who have not entered ultimate determination eat this food, it will be digested whe
n they enter that determination.When those who have entered ultimate determination eat this food, it will not be digeste
d until their minds are totally liberated.If living beings who have not conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enli
ghtenment eat this food, it will be digested when they conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment.If those
who have conceived the spirit of perfect enlightenment eat this food, it will not be digested until they have attained 
tolerance.And if those who have attained tolerance eat this food, it will be digested when they have become bodhisattvas
one lifetime away from Buddhahood.
