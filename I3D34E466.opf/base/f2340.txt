Furthermore, he should understand thoroughly the conception of himself as a thing by cultivating the following considerat
ion:’Just as in the case of the conception of "self," so the conception of "thing" is also a misunderstanding,and this m
isunderstanding is also a grave sickness;I should free myself from this sicknessand should strive to abandon it.’"What i
s the elimination of this sickness?It is the elimination of egoism and possessiveness.What is the elimination of egoism 
and possessiveness?It is the freedom from dualism.What is freedom from dualism?It is the absence of involvement with eit
her the external or the internal.What is absence of involvement with either external or internal?It is nondeviation, non
fluctuation, and nondistraction from equanimity.What is equanimity?It is the equality of everything from self to liberat
ion.Why?Because both self and liberation are void.How can both be void?As verbal designations, they both are void,and ne
ither is established in reality.Therefore, one who sees such equality makes no difference between sickness and voidness;
his sickness is itself voidness,and that sickness as voidness is itself void.
