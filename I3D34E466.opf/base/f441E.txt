Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti set himself in such a concentration and performed such a miraculous feat(that those bodhis
attvas and those great disciples were enabled to see the universe called Sarvagandhasugandha, )which is located in the d
irection of the zenith, beyond as many buddha-fields as there are sands in forty-two Ganges rivers.that those bodhisattv
as and those great disciples were enabled to see the universe called Sarvagandhasugandha, (which is located in the direc
tion of the zenith, beyond as many buddha-fields as there are sands in forty-two Ganges rivers. )There the Tathāgata nam
ed Sugandhakūṭa resides, lives, and is manifest.In that universe, (the trees emit a fragrance that far surpasses all the
fragrances,) human and divine, of all the buddha-fields of the ten directions.In that universe, the trees emit a fragra
nce that far surpasses all the fragrances, (human and divine, of all the buddha-fields of the ten directions. )In that u
niverse, even the names "disciple" and "solitary sage" do not exist,and the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa teaches the Dharma to
a gathering of bodhisattvas only.In that universe, all the houses, the avenues, the parks, and the palaces are made of 
various perfumes,and the fragrance of the food eaten by those bodhisattvas pervades immeasurable universes.

At this time, the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa sat down with his bodhisattvas to take his meal,and the deities called Gandhavyū
hāhāra, who were all devoted to the Mahāyāna, served and attended upon the Buddha and his bodhisattvas.Everyone in the g
athering at the house of Vimalakīrti was able to see distinctly this universe wherein the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa and his
bodhisattvas were taking their meal.
