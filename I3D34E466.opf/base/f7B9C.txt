You should accept alms by not taking anythingYou should see form like a man blind from birthhear sounds as if they were e
choessmell scents as if they were windsexperience tastes without any discriminationtouch tangibles in awareness of the u
ltimate lack of contact in gnosisand know things with the consciousness of an illusory creatureThat which is without int
rinsic substance and without imparted substance does not burnAnd what does not burn will not be extinguished.
