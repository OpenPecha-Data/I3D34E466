"The Licchavi Vimalakīrti, having received the goddesses, said to them,’Now that you have been given to me by Māra,you sh
ould all conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment.’"He then exhorted them with discourse suitable for th
eir development toward enlightenment, and soon they conceived the spirit of enlightenment.

He then said to them, ’You have just conceived the spirit of enlightenment.From now on, you should devote yourselves to f
ind joy in pleasures of the Dharma, and should take no pleasure in desires.’ "

They then asked him, ’What is "joy in the pleasures of the Dharma"?’ "

He declared, ’It is the joy of unbreakable faith in the Buddha,of wishing to hear the Dharma,of serving the Sanghaand hon
oring the spiritual benefactors without pride.It is the joy of renunciation of the whole world,of not being fixed in obj
ects,of considering the five aggregates to be like murderers,of considering the elements to be like venomous serpents,an
d of considering the sense-media to be like an empty town.It is the joy of always guarding the spirit of enlightenment,o
f helping living beings,of sharing through generosity,of not slackening in morality,of control and tolerance in patience
,of thorough cultivation of virtue by effort,of total absorption in meditation,and of absence of passions in wisdom.It i
s the joy of extending enlightenment,of conquering the Māras,of destroying the passions,and of purifying the buddha-fiel
d.It is the joy of accumulating all virtues, in order to cultivate the auspicious marks and signs.Order is differentIt i
s the joy of the liberation of nonintimidation when hearing the profound teaching.It is the joy of exploration of the th
ree doors of liberation,and of the realization of liberation.It is the joy of being an ornament of the seat of enlighten
ment,and of not attaining liberation at the wrong time.It is the joy of serving those of equal fortune,of not hating or 
resenting those of superior fortune,of serving the spiritual benefactors,and of avoiding sinful friends.It is the joy of
the superior gladness of faith and devotion to the Dharma.It is the joy of acquiring liberative techniquesand of the co
nscious cultivation of the aids to enlightenment.Thus, the bodhisattva admires and finds joy in the delights of the Dhar
ma.’
