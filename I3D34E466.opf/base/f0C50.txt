Mañjuśrī then asked further, "Noble sir, if a bodhisattva considers all living beings in such a way,how does he generate 
the great love toward them?"

Vimalakīrti replied, "Mañjuśrī, when a bodhisattva considers all living beings in this way,he thinks: ’Just as I have rea
lized the Dharma, so should I teach it to living beings.’Thereby, he generates the love that is truly a refuge for all l
iving beings;the love that is peaceful because free of grasping;the love that is not feverish, because free of passions;
the love that accords with reality because it is equanimous in all three times;the love that is without conflict because
free of the violence of the passions;the love that is nondual because it is involved neither with the external nor with
the internal;the love that is imperturbable because totally ultimate."Thereby he generates the love that is firm, its h
igh resolve unbreakable, like a diamond;the love that is pure, purified in its intrinsic nature;the love that is even, i
ts aspirations being equal;the saint’s love that has eliminated its enemy;the bodhisattva’s love that continuously devel
ops living beings;The Tathāgata’s love that understands reality;the Buddha’s love that causes living beings to awaken fr
om their sleep;the love that is spontaneous because it is fully enlightened spontaneously;the love that is enlightenment
because it is unity of experience;the love that has no presumption because it has eliminated attachment and aversion;th
e love that is great compassion because it infuses the Mahāyāna with radiance;the love that is never exhausted because i
t acknowledges voidness and selflessness;the love that is giving because it bestows the gift of Dharma free of the tight
fist of a bad teacher;the love that is morality because it improves immoral living beings;the love that is tolerance be
cause it protects both self and others;the love that is effort because it takes responsibility for all living beings;the
love that is contemplation because it refrains from indulgence in tastes;the love that is wisdom because it causes atta
inment at the proper time;the love that is liberative technique because it shows the way everywhere;the love that is wit
hout formality because it is pure in motivation;the love that is without deviation because it acts from decisive motivat
ion;the love that is high resolve because it is without passions;the love that is without deceit because it is not artif
icial;the love that is happiness because it introduces living beings to the happiness of the Buddha.Such, Mañjuśrī, is t
he great love of a bodhisattva."
