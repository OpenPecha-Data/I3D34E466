Reverend Śāriputra, he who is interested in the Dharma is not interested in recognizing suffering,abandoning its originat
ion,realizing its cessation,or practicing the path.Why?The Dharma is ultimately without formulationand without verbaliza
tion.Who verbalizes: ’Suffering should be recognized, origination should be eliminated, cessation should be realized, th
e path should be practiced,’ is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in verbalization. "Reverend Śāriputra, th
e Dharma is calm and peaceful.Those who are engaged in production and destruction are not interested in the Dharma, are 
not interested in solitude, but are interested in production and destruction."Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, the Dharm
a is without taint and free of defilement.He who is attached to anything, even to liberation,is not interested in the Dh
arma but is interested in the taint of desire.The Dharma is not an object.He who pursues objects is not interested in th
e Dharma but is interested in objects.The Dharma is without acceptance or rejection.He who holds on to things or lets go
of things is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in holding and letting go.
