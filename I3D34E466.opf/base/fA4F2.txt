Reverend Pūrṇa, first concentrate yourself, regard the minds of these young bhikshus, and then teach them the Dharma!Do n
ot put rotten food into a jeweled bowl!First understand the inclinations of these monksand do not confuse priceless sapp
hires with glass beads!Reverend Pūrṇa, without examining the spiritual faculties of living beings, do not presume upon t
he one-sidedness of their faculties;do not wound those who are without wounds;do not impose a narrow path upon those who
aspire to a great path;do not try to pour the great ocean into the hoof-print of an ox;do not try to put Mount Sumeru i
nto a grain of mustard;do not confuse the brilliance of the sun with the light of a glowworm;and do not expose those who
admire the roar of a lion to the howl of a jackal!Reverend Pūrṇa, all these monks were formerly engaged in the Mahāyāna
but have forgotten the spirit of enlightenment.Do not, therefore, O Hoonourable Pūrṇa, teach them the Listeners Vehicle
. The Listeners Vehicle is shallow.So do not instruct them in the disciple-vehicle. The disciple-vehicle is not ultimate
ly valid, and you disciples are like men blind from birth, in regard to recognition of the degrees of the spiritual facu
lties of living beings.
