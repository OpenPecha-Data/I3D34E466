Thereupon, Mañjuśrī, the crown prince, addressed the Licchavi Vimalakīrti:"Good sir, how should a bodhisattva regard all 
living beings?"Vimalakīrti replied, "Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva should regard all livings beings (as a wise man regards the
reflection of the moon in water or) as magicians regard men created by magic.

(Vimalakīrti replied, "Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva should regard all livings beings )as a wise man regards the reflection of 
the moon in water (or as magicians regard men created by magic).(He should regard them as being )like a face in a mirror
;He should regard them as being (like a face in a mirror; )like the water of a mirage;disorder, see abovelike the sound 
of an echo;like a mass of clouds in the sky;like the previous moment of a ball of foam;like the appearance and disappear
ance of a bubble of water;like the core of a plantain tree;like a flash of lightning;like the fifth great element;like t
he seventh sense-medium;like the appearance of matter in an immaterial realm;like a sprout from a rotten seed;like a tor
toise-hair coat;like the fun of games for one who wishes to die;like the egoistic views of a stream-winner;like a third 
rebirth of a once-returner;like the descent of a nonreturner into a womb;like the existence of desire, hatred, and folly
in a saint;like thoughts of avarice, immorality, wickedness, and hostility in a bodhisattva who has attained tolerance;
like the instincts of passions in a Tathāgata;like the perception of color in one blind from birth;like the inhalation a
nd exhalation of an ascetic absorbed in the meditation of cessation;like the track of a bird in the sky;like the erectio
n of a eunuch;like the pregnancy of a barren woman;like the unproduced passions of an emanated incarnation of the Tathāg
ata;like dream-visions seen after waking;like the passions of one who is free of conceptualizations;like fire burning wi
thout fuel;like the reincarnation of one who has attained ultimate liberation."Precisely thus, Mañjuśrī, does a bodhisat
tva who realizes the ultimate selflessness consider all beings."
