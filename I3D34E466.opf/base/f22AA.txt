The Dharma-sacrifice consists of the meditation of voidness, consummated in effectiveness in the development of all livin
g beings;of the meditation of signlessness, consummated in the purification of all compounded things;and of the meditati
on of wishlessness, consummated in voluntarily assuming rebirths.
