Then, the Buddha said to the crown prince, Mañjuśrī,"Mañjuśrī, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illnes
s."

Mañjuśrī replied, "Lord, it is difficult to attend upon the Licchavi Vimalakīrti.He is gifted with marvelous eloquence co
ncerning the law of the profound.He is extremely skilled in full expressions and in the reconciliation of dichotomies.Hi
s eloquence is inexorable,and no one can resist his imperturbable intellect.He accomplishes all the activities of the bo
dhisattvas.He penetrates all the secret mysteries of the bodhisattvas and the Buddhas.He is skilled in civilizing all th
e abodes of devils. He plays with the great superknowledges.He is consummate in wisdom and liberative technique.He has a
ttained the supreme excellence of the indivisible, nondual sphere of the ultimate realm.He is skilled in teaching the Dh
arma with its infinite modalities within the uniform ultimate.He is skilled in granting means of attainment in accordanc
e with the spiritual faculties of all living beings.He has thoroughly integrated his realization with skill in liberativ
e technique.He has attained decisiveness with regard to all questions.Thus, although he cannot be withstood by someone o
f my feeble defenses,still, sustained by the grace of the Buddha, I will go to himand will converse with him as well as 
I can."
