Thereupon, the entire multitude experienced the desireto behold the universe Abhirati, the Tathāgata Akṣobhya, his bodhis
attvas, and his great disciples.

The Buddha, knowing the thoughts of the entire multitude,said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti,"Noble son, this multitude wish
es to behold the universe Abhirati and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya -show them!"

Then the Licchavi Vimalakīrti thought,"Without rising from my couch,I shall pick up in my right hand the universe Abhirat
i and all it contains:its hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas; its abodes of devas, nagas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and asu
ras,bounded by its Cakravada mountains; its rivers, lakes, fountains, streams, oceans, and other bodies of water;its Mou
nt Sumeru and other hills and mountain ranges;its moon, its sun, and its stars;its devas, nagas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and
asuras themselves; its Brahmā and his retinues;its villages, cities, towns, provinces, kingdoms, men, women, and houses
;its bodhisattvas; its disciples;the tree of enlightenment of the Tathāgata Akṣobhya;and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya himself,
seated in the middle of an assembly vast as an ocean, teaching the Dharma.Also the lotuses that accomplish the buddha-w
ork among the living beings;the three jeweled ladders that rise from its earth to its Trayastriṃśā heaven,on which ladde
rs the gods of that heaven descend to the world to see, honor, and serve the Tathāgata Akṣobhya and to hear the Dharma,a
nd on which the men of the earth climb to the Trayastriṃśā heaven to visit those gods.(Like a potter with his wheel), I 
will reduce that universe Abhirati, with its store of innumerable virtues, from its watery base up to its Akanistha heav
en, to a minute sizeand, carrying it gently like a garland of flowers, will bring it to this Sahā universeand will show 
it to the multitudes."
