The bodhisattva Prabhāketu declared,"To say that the four main elements are one thing and the etheric space-element anoth
er is dualistic.The four main elements are themselves the nature of space.The past itself is also the nature of space. T
he future itself is also the nature of space. Likewise, the present itself is also the nature of space.The gnosis that p
enetrates the elements in such a way is the entrance into nonduality."
