Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the crown prince Mañjuśrī,"Mañjuśrī, what is the ’family of the Tathāgatas’?"

Mañjuśrī replied, "Noble sir, the family of the Tathāgatas consists of all basic egoism;of ignorance and the thirst for e
xistence;of lust, hate, and folly;of the four misapprehensions,of the five obscurations,of the six media of sense,of the
seven abodes of consciousness,of the eight false paths,of the nine causes of irritation,of the paths of ten sins.Such i
s the family of the Tathāgatas.In short, noble sir, the sixty-two kinds of convictions constitute the family of the Tath
āgatas!"
