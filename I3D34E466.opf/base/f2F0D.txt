When the bodhisattvas had given their explanations, they all addressed the crown prince Mañjuśrī:"Mañjuśrī, what is the b
odhisattva’s entrance into nonduality?"

Mañjuśrī replied,"Good sirs, you have all spoken well.Nevertheless, all your explanations are themselves dualistic.To kno
w no one teaching, to express nothing, to say nothing, to explain nothing, to announce nothing, to indicate nothing, and
to designate nothing -that is the entrance into nonduality."
