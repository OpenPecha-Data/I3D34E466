Vimalakīrti replied, ’Sisters, there is a door of the Dharma called "The Inexhaustible Lamp." Practice it!What is it? Sis
ters, a single lamp may light hundreds of thousands of lampswithout itself being diminished.Likewise, sisters, a single 
bodhisattva may establish many hundreds of thousands of living beings in enlightenmentwithout his mindfulness being dimi
nished. In fact, not only does it not diminish, it grows stronger.Likewise, the more you teach and demonstrate virtuous 
qualities to others, the more you grow with respect to these virtuous qualities.This is the door of the Dharma called "T
he Inexhaustible Lamp."When you are living in the realm of Māra, inspire innumerable gods and goddesses with the spirit 
of enlightenment.In such a way, you will repay the kindness of the Tathāgata,and you will become the benefactors of all 
living beings.’
