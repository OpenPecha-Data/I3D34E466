For example, Mañjuśrī, when the only son of a merchant is sick,both his parents become sick on account of the sickness of
their son.And the parents will suffer as long as that only son does not recover from his sickness.Just so, Mañjuśrī, th
e bodhisattva loves all living beings as if each were his only child.He becomes sick when they are sick and is cured whe
n they are cured.You ask me, Mañjuśrī, whence comes my sickness;the sicknesses of the bodhisattvas arise from great comp
assion."
