Reverend Ānanda, the Tathāgatas have the body of the Dharma - not a body that is sustained by material food.The Tathāgata
s have a transcendental body that has transcended all mundane qualities.There is no injury to the body of a Tathāgata, a
s it is rid of all defilements.The body of a Tathāgata is uncompounded and free of all formative activity.Reverend Ānand
a, to believe there can be illness in such a body is irrational and unseemly!
