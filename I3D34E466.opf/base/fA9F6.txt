Then, prince of gods, the prince Candracchattra, out of his great faith in the Tathāgata, left the household life in orde
r to enter the homeless life of a monkHaving made great effort and being well established in virtue, he soon produced th
e five superknowledges,understood the incantations, and obtained the invincible eloquence.When the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarā
ja attained ultimate liberation, Candracchattra, on the strength of his superknowledges and by the power of his incantat
ions, made the wheel of the Dharma turn just as the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja had done and continued to do so for ten shor
t aeons."Prince of gods, while the monk Candracchattra was exerting himself thus to protect the holy Dharma, thousands o
f millions of living beings reached the stage of irreversibility on the path to unexcelled, perfect enlightenment,fourte
en billion living beings were disciplined in the vehicles of the disciples and solitary sages,and innumerable living bei
ngs took rebirth in the human and heavenly realms.
