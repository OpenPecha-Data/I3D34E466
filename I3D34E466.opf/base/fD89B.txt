"Maitreya, there are two gestures of the bodhisattvas.What are they?The first gesture is to believe in all sorts of phras
es and words,and the second gesture is to penetrate exactly the profound principle of the Dharma without being afraid.Su
ch are the two gestures of the bodhisattvas.Maitreya, it must be known that the bodhisattvas who believe in all sorts of
words and phrases, and apply themselves accordingly, are beginnersand not experienced in religious practice.But the bod
hisattvas who read, hear, believe, and teach this profound teaching with its impeccable expressions reconciling dichotom
ies and its analyses of stages of development these are veterans in the religious practice.
