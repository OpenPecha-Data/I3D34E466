The bodhisattva Siṃhamati declared,"To say, ’This is impure’ and ’This is immaculate’ makes for duality.One who, attainin
g equanimity, forms no conception of impurity or immaculateness,yet is not utterly without conception, has equanimity wi
thout any attainment of equanimity - he enters the absence of conceptual knots.Thus, he enters into nonduality."
