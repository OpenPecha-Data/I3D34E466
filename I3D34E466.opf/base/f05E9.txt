No one abides in, or regresses from, enlightenment.Maitreya, you should introduce these deities to the repudiation of all
discriminative constructions concerning enlightenment.

"’Enlightenment is perfectly realized neither by the body nor by the mind.Enlightenment is the eradication of all marks.E
nlightenment is free of presumptions concerning all objects.Enlightenment is free of the functioning of all intentional 
thoughts.Enlightenment is the annihilation of all convictions.Enlightenment is free from all discriminative construction
s.Enlightenment is free from all vacillation, mentation, and agitation.Enlightenment is not involved in any commitments.
Enlightenment is the arrival at detachment, through freedom from all habitual attitudes.The ground of enlightenment is t
he ultimate realm.Enlightenment is realization of reality.Enlightenment abides at the limit of reality.Enlightenment is 
without duality, since therein are no minds and no things.Enlightenment is equality, since it is equal to infinite space
. "’Enlightenment is unconstructed, because it is neither born nor destroyed, neither abides nor undergoes any transform
ation.Enlightenment is the complete knowledge of the thoughts, deeds, and inclinations of all living beings.Enlightenmen
t is not a door for the six media of sense.Enlightenment is unadulterated, since it is free of the passions of the insti
nctually driven succession of lives.Enlightenment is neither somewhere nor nowhere, abiding in no location or dimension.
Enlightenment, not being contained in anything, does not stand in reality.Enlightenment is merely a name and even that n
ame is unmoving.Enlightenment, free of abstention and undertaking, is energyless.There is no agitation in enlightenment,
as it is utterly pure by nature.Enlightenment is radiance, pure in essence.Enlightenment is without subjectivity and co
mpletely without object.Enlightenment, which penetrates the equality of all things, is undifferentiated.Enlightenment, w
hich is not shown by any example, is incomparable.Enlightenment is subtle, since it is extremely difficult to realize.En
lightenment is all-pervasive, as it has the nature of infinite space.Enlightenment cannot be realized, either physically
or mentally.Why? The body is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and hallucinations. And the mind is immaterial, invisible
, baseless, and unconscious.’
