Then the four Mahārājas, the great kings of the quarters, said to the Buddha,"Lord, in all the towns, villages, cities, k
ingdoms, and palaces, wherever this discourse of the Dharma will be practised, upheld, and correctly taught,we, the four
great kings, will go there with our armies, our young warriors, and our retinues, to hear the Dharma.And we will protec
t the teachers of this Dharma for a radius of one leagueso that no one who plots injury or disruption against these teac
hers will have any opportunity to do them harm."
