Thereupon, the Buddha Śākyamuni asked all the multitudes,"Friends, behold the splendors of the universe Abhirati, the Tat
hāgata Akṣobhya, the array of his buddha-field, and the splendors of these disciples and bodhisattvas!"

They replied, "We see them, Lord!"

The Buddha said, "Those bodhisattvas who wish to embrace such a buddha-field should train themselves in all the bodhisatt
va-practices of the Tathāgata Akṣobhya."

While Vimalakīrti, with his miraculous power, showed them thus the universe Abhirati and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya,one hundr
ed and forty thousand living beings among the men and gods of the Sahā universe conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perf
ect enlightenment,and all of them formed a prayer to be reborn in the universe Abhirati.And the Buddha prophesied that i
n the future all would be reborn in the universe Abhirati.And the Licchavi Vimalakīrti, having thus developed all the li
ving beings who could thereby be developed,returned the universe Abhirati exactly to its former place.
