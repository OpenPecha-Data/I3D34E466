"There are two reasons the bodhisattvas who do aspire to the profound Dharma hurt themselvesand do not attain the toleran
ce of the ultimate birthlessness of things.What are these two?These bodhisattvas despise and reproach the beginner bodhi
sattvas, who have not been practicing for a long time,and they do not initiate them or instruct them in the profound tea
ching.Having no great respect for this profound teaching, they are not careful about its rules.They help living beings b
y means of material gifts and do not help them by means of the gift of the Dharma.Such, Maitreya, are the two reasons th
e bodhisattvas who aspire to the profound Dharma hurt themselvesand will not quickly attain the tolerance of the ultimat
e birthlessness of all things."
