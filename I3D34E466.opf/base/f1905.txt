"The Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja said,’Noble son, the Dharma-worship is that worship rendered to the discourses taught by the
Tathāgata. These discourses are deep and profound in illumination.They do not conform to the mundane and are difficult 
to understand, difficult to see and difficult to realize. They are subtle, precise, and ultimately incomprehensible.As S
criptures, they are collected in the canon of the bodhisattvas, stamped with the insignia of the king of incantations an
d teachings.They reveal the irreversible wheel of Dharma,arising from the six transcendences,cleansed of any false notio
ns.They are endowed with all the aids to enlightenment and embody the seven factors of enlightenment.They introduce livi
ng beings to the great compassion and teach them the great love.They eliminate all the convictions of the Māras, and the
y manifest relativity.
