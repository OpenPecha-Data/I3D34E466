As soon as these precious parasols had been set down suddenly by the power of the Buddha, they joined together into one s
ingle precious parasoland that one single precious parasol covered all that trichiliomegachiliocosm. The surface of the 
trichiliomegachiliocosm appeared on the inside itself of that great precious parasol.Thus there could be seen on the ins
ide of that great precious parasol all that the trichiliomegachiliocosm contained: Sumeru the king of mountains, Himadri
, Mucilinda, Maḥamucilinda, Gandhamādana, Ratnaparvata, Kālaparvata, Cakravāḍa and Mahācakravāḍa;the great oceans, tsate
r-courses, lakes, ponds, rivers, streams and springs;then, in infinite quantities, the suns, moons and stars, the dwelli
ngs of the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, as well as the dwellings of the catur
mahārājas;finally, the villages, towns, boroughs, provinces, kingdoms, capitals and all the surrounding territories.And 
the instruction in the Law expounded in the world of ten regions by the Blessed Lord Buddhas could be heard in its entir
ety, as if their voices came from that one single great precious parasol.
