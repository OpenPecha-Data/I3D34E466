Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Śāriputra: Can you see, Śāriputra, the splendour of the virtues of my Buddha-f
ield?

Yes, I can see O Blessed One, that splendour that has never been seen or heard before.

The Buddha continued: Śāriputra, my Buddhakṣetra is always as pure as this, but, to help inferior beings ripen, the Tathā
gata makes it appear like a field vitiated with many flaws.For example, O Śāriputra, the sons of the gods take their foo
d from one single precious receptacle, but thye ambrosia which is the food of the gods varies according to the diverse m
erits accumulated by the gods. Equally Śāriputra, beings born in the same Buddhakṣetra see, in proportion to their purit
y, the splendour of the Buddhakṣetra of the Buddhas.
