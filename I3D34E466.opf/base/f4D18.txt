Reverend Ānanda, go in silence, and do not belittle the Lord.Do not say such things to others.It would not be good for th
e powerful gods or for the bodhisattvas coming from the various buddha-fields to hear such words.Reverend Ānanda, a univ
ersal monarch, who is endowed only with a small root of virtue, is free of diseases.How then could the Lord, who has an 
infinite root of virtue, have any disease? It is impossible.Reverend Ānanda, do not bring shame upon us, but go in silen
celest the heterodox sectarians should hear your words. They would sayFor shame! The teacher of these people cannot even
cure his own sicknesses.How then can he cure the sicknesses of others?Reverend Ānanda, go then discreetly so that no on
e observes you.
