The bodhisattva Puṇyakṣetra declared,"It is dualistic to consider actions meritorious, sinful, or neutral.The non-underta
king of meritorious, sinful, and neutral actions is not dualistic.The intrinsic nature of all such actions is voidness,w
herein ultimately there is neither merit, nor sin, nor neutrality, nor action itself.The nonaccomplishment of such actio
ns is the entrance into nonduality."
