"Such a bodhisattva can pick up with his right hand this billion-world-galactic universe as if it were a potterâ€™s wheel a
nd, spinning it round, throw it beyond universes as numerous as the sands of the Ganges,without the living beings therei
n knowing their motion or its origin,and he can catch it and put it back in its place,without the living beings suspecti
ng their coming and going;and yet the whole operation is visible.
