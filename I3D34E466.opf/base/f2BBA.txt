Why?Good sirs, in this Sahā universe, there are ten virtuous practiceswhich do not exist in any other buddha-field.What a
re these ten?Here they are: to win the poor by generosity;to win the immoral by morality;to win the hateful by means of 
tolerance;to win the lazy by means of effort;to win the mentally troubled by means of concentration;to win the falsely w
ise by means of true wisdom;to show those suffering from the eight adversities how to rise above them;to teach the Mahāy
āna to those of narrow-minded behavior;to win those who have not produced the roots of virtue by means of the roots of v
irtue;and to develop living beings without interruption through the four means of unification.Those who engage in these 
ten virtuous practices do not exist in any other buddha-field."
